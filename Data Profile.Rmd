I am a budding data scientist with good technical background, resilient and goaloriented. I am one person who likes being productive and would like to get on any interesting project. Please find below a bar chart of my data science profile.

```{r echo=FALSE}
Criteria <- c("Reading", "Critical thinking", "time management", "Mathematics", "computer programming", "System design", "Listening", "Curiosity", "Team work", "Report writing")
score <- c(8, 7, 8, 6,5, 6.5, 9, 8, 10, 7)
Data_Science_Profile <- data.frame(Criteria, score)

# Create a Bar chart

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = Data_Science_Profile, aes(x=Criteria, y=score)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
